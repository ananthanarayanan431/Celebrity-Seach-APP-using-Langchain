Generally, the more money you make, the higher the rate of tax. The rate of tax also varies depending on your filing status. For example, married couples filing jointly usually have a lower rate of tax than single filers.\\n\\nAdditionally, different types of income are taxed at different rates.

It is important to understand how these rates work and how they apply to your particular situation.\\n\\nFinally, there are several deductions and credits available to help reduce your tax burden.
